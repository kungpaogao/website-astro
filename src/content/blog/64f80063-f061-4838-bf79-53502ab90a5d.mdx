Note: I think I should rework the criteria a little bit. Right now, these are categorized into these tiers based on ~~vibes~~, but I think I should do something like “would go out of my way to get”, “would purchase if I saw it in supermarket”, and “would not eat for free.” However, “vibes” allows me to capture a wide variety of factors like (economic) value, taste, personal sentiment, and consistency.
