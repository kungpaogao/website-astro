It all started around when my dad brought home a Lenovo IdeaPad K1 tablet and a ThinkPad T500. I fell in love with Minecraft: Pocket Edition (MC:PE), which led me to find the Internet. I created my Twitter account to tweet at an MC:PE developer, and I was pretty active on Minecraft Forum.

<br />


On Twitter (and Google+), I learned more about computers, such as installing Linux and rooting Android devices. I installed Xubuntu on my T500 and a custom ROM on my K1, and I discovered my love for tinkering with software.

<br />


I probably started “coding” around 2013-2014. I took classes in high school such as AP Computer Science, but my most relevant experience came from a summer program at WPI. There, I worked on an Android app that allowed users to take pictures of and identify bumblebees, which was then used to study pollinator decline. I think the “code” I wrote was almost all XML (no actual business logic) because I was converting the app to be “Material Design,” but it was a great experience nonetheless. I also got to build the website, which somehow still exists today. This is where I fell in love with building frontends.

<br />


At Cornell, I studied computer science, so the path is pretty boring from there. During college, I continued working on Android apps and picked up modern web development (Vue, then React, and now [insert whatever is sexy in 2022]). I interned at “startups”, Qualtrics, and Robinhood. And now, I work full-time at Robinhood, where I make pretty screens and buttons.
