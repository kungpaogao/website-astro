<br />


Edit: I found this [Bogleheads wiki page](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments) that explains what I try to do, but better. You should read it first.

<br />


My investment strategy is pretty brainless.

<br />


First priority for me is retirement funds and other pre-tax savings:
- max out 401k and take advantage of company match
- max out HSA (I’m on a high deductible plan for now)
- max out IRAs
- keep commuter benefits filled
- put some money into ESPP

<br />


After taxes, I split my paycheck:
- couple hundred goes into my bank’s checking account (to pay for credit cards, etc.)
- about 1/3 into [Robinhood Gold](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/) sweep
- rest split between like VOO, VTI, SPY, QQQ, BRK.B

<br />


I will probably rebalance this if/when the rates go down, and/or the stock market improves. I will probably increase the investments in stocks vs. sweeps.

<br />


In the future, I would like to learn how to trade options.
