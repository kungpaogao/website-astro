<i>This is not investment advice. This is just my personal “strategy.” I also work for Robinhood, but I pay for Robinhood Gold with my own money.</i>

<br />


My investment strategy is pretty brainless.

First priority for me is retirement funds and other pre-tax savings:
- max out 401k and take advantage of company match
- max out HSA (on a high deductible plan for now)
- max out commuter benefits

<br />


After taxes, I split my paycheck:
- couple hundred goes into savings account
- 60% VOO
- 10% VTI
- 40% Robinhood Gold ([4% cash sweep](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/earn-4-percent-apy-with-robinhood-gold))

<br />


I will probably rebalance this if/when the rates go down, and/or the stock market improves. It will probably be 60% VOO, 30% VTI, 10% cash.
