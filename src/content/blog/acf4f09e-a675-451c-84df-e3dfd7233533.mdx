import { Image } from 'astro:assets';


for reference, my go to orders at most places are:
- (real/smashed) taro, milk-based drink (if available)
- normal milk tea
- real fruit milk tea (like jooy)
- 50% sugar, less/no ice, bubbles/jelly
- kind of a fruit tea hater unless it’s real fruit
- i live in nyc, so most of these are based on nyc locations

## s tier

- xing fu tang - great bubbles, great tea, has taro drink
- yomies - not really boba, but like them bc  they are doing smth different and i like the taste of beijing yogurt 

## a

- jooy - PERSIMMON DRINK, amazing rotating menus, real fruits
- 50-lan - amazing milk tea flavor, not super into the golden bubbles
